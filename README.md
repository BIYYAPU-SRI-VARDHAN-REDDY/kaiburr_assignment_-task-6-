Task 6. Data Science example.
Implement a sample machine learning program for a problem statement of your choice

# steps for task-6 solution
Importing libraries: In the first step, we import the required libraries for our program. We need pandas for data manipulation, numpy for numerical operations, sklearn for machine learning models, warnings to ignore any warnings that may arise, and pickle to save the trained model for later use.

Loading data: Next, we load our dataset using the pandas library. This dataset contains information about different crops and their attributes like nitrogen, phosphorous, potassium levels, and pH values.

Data preprocessing: The loaded dataset is then preprocessed to remove any missing or duplicate values. We drop any columns that are not required, like the crop name, as it will not be used in the model.

Splitting data: The data is then split into training and testing sets. We use 80% of the data for training and 20% for testing.

Training the model: We use the RandomForestClassifier algorithm from sklearn library to train our model. It is a popular machine learning algorithm used for classification tasks. We fit our model to the training data.

Testing the model: After training the model, we test its performance on the testing dataset. We use the accuracy_score function from sklearn to calculate the accuracy of the model.

Saving the model: Once the model has been trained and tested, we save it using the pickle library. This is done so that the trained model can be used later without the need for retraining.

Overall, this program implements a machine learning solution for the problem statement of crop recommendation. It loads a dataset, preprocesses it, trains a model on the data, tests the performance of the model, and finally saves the trained model for later use.
